    [Sat Oct  7 10:03:41 2023] PHP 8.2.11 Development Server (http://0.0.0.0:8000) started

# Verifying installation
Open http://localhost:8000, you should be greeted with "Welcome to Symfony 6.3.4".

# Copy the files
Copy the following files:
- serdao-test-files/UserController.php => app/src/Controller/
- serdao-test-files/user.html.twig => app/templates/

# Test the application
Now that the files are copied, open http://localhost:8000/user . You should see an HTML form with the fields "First name", "Last name" and "Address".
There should also be a list of user at the bottom of the page with 3 famous people in it.

Input a first name, a last name and an address, then click on the submit button to append a new user to the database.
The user should then appear in the user table.

# Instructions
Finally, we can code! The code in UserController.php is, well, no great. Let's put it that way :).
Please refactor it in a way that would make it suitable for running on a production environment by following best practices.

Notes:
- You can use any features of PHP <= 8.2
- You do not have to change the look and feel of the interface, but you are allowed to change the user.html.twig file to match any changes in the controller
- You are free to change whatever you want
- You can spend as much time as you want on that test, but 2 hours should be enough for you to pass.
- Make sure the code works before sending it back, if you don't have time to implement everything, just comment what you would have liked to implement
